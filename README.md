Files for a simple macropad for playing the game of Dans-Stopp (dance stop)

The device is a 3D-printed chunky button with a microswitch hidden inside. The microswict is connected over a 3.3V pullup to the ESP32 packaged inside
The software is mainly using the ESP-32-BLE-Keyboard library to send play/pause commands automatically and when the button is actuated (https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard)
